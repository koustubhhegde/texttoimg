# Text-to-Image Converter
This project implements a Text-to-Image Converter using deep learning models. It takes textual input from the user and generates a relevant image based on the description. The system leverages state-of-the-art NLP and Computer Vision models to translate natural language into visual representations.

## Features
- Converts textual descriptions into realistic images
- Supports detailed and creative prompts
- User-friendly interface for entering text and viewing results
- Fast generation with GPU acceleration support
- Works with multiple styles (photorealistic, artistic, etc.)

## Technologies Used
Python - Core programming language

PyTorch / TensorFlow - For model implementation

HuggingFace Transformers - For leveraging pretrained models like DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion
